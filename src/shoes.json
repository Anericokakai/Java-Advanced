Like the “Royal,” black leather appears on the perforated toe and on the mid-panel, collar, and heel of the “Hyper Cobalt.” Blue leather overlays on the forefoot, eyelets, collar, and heel pop against the neutral base. A Hyper Cobalt leather Swoosh appears on either side of the shoe and black “Nike” embroidery is stitched onto the heel. Blue “Nike” detailing appears on the branding tag on the black nylon tongue.
